Welcome to my small godot implementations of CS101 algorithms!
I intend to visualize some very simple algorithms here using godot
Here the list of algorithms are:
1. The Fibonacci Series - work in progress (not uploaded) - 17/01/2025
2. Climbing Stairs - not started
3. N Queens Problem - not started
4. Tower of Hanoi - not started

These are to be hosted on the vercel site: https://i-panicked-and-made-this.vercel.app
